# SPAM SMS Prediction :notebook:
In this repo i have created a SMS Spam Prediction project in machine learning using NLP, and i am using [nltk](https://pypi.org/project/nltk/) Library for NLP.



# Motivation :monocle_face:
  - Day by day people get a lot of sms, In those sms include are spam and helpful message. In today's runaway life we don't have enough time to recognize these sms whether it is spam or not, so i have develop a machine learning programme using kaggle dataset which will split the sms. Hope this programme are helpful for you. 

# Dependencies :- 
  Python 3.x 
  scikit-learn
  NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
  Pandas
  NumPy
  
# Future Improvements:- 
 Experiment with different machine learning algorithms and feature engineering techniques to improve model performance.
 Explore deep learning approaches such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers for text classification tasks.
 Fine-tune hyperparameters of the models to achieve better results.
 Collect more labeled data or use data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the dataset.
